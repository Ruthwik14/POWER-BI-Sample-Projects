# üí¨ Chatbot Journey Insights and Performance Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project addresses the critical need for efficient and insightful management of **Yojana promotion in election campaigning**. With citizen inquiries originating from chatbots and missed calls across three different languages, and then being directed to specialized call centers for resolution, there was a challenge in gaining a unified view of the citizen journey and agent performance.

The **Chatbot Journey Insights and Performance Dashboard** was developed to provide a comprehensive, real-time overview of the entire citizen interaction process. This dashboard visually maps out the paths citizens take when seeking assistance, from initial chatbot interactions and missed calls to the eventual resolution by specialized call centers. It allows for the identification of bottlenecks, understanding citizen needs, and evaluating the effectiveness of various support channels and call centers, ultimately improving service delivery for individuals seeking assistance with Yojana (government scheme) related queries.

## üìä Data Description

The project utilizes a rich dataset encompassing citizen interactions from multiple sources, as shown in the provided data schemas:

* **Chatbot Data **: Records of conversations initiated through the chatbot, available in English, French, and German. Key fields include \`Age Group\`, \`Call center\`, \`Canton\`, \`Chat Date\`, \`Chat Time\`, \`District\`, \`Gender\`, \`Issue\`, \`Language\`, \`Mobile Number\`, \`Name\`, \`Scheme Status\`, and \`Scheme\`.

* **Missed Call Data **: Information on calls that were initially missed and then routed through the chatbot or directly to call centers. Key fields include \`CALL STATUS\`, \`CALLER\`, \`DATE\`, \`DayName\`, \`DURATION\`, \`PULSE COUNT\`, \`TIME\`, \`TIME (bins)\`, and \`VIRTUAL NUM\`.

* **Our Call Center Data **: Records from the primary call center detailing resolution status, call types, and caller information. Key fields include \`Age Group\`, \`Agent Name\`, \`Call Date\`, \`Call Time\`, \`Call Type\`, \`Canton\`, \`Chat Date\`, \`Data From\`, \`Dialer Comments\`, \`Dialer Status\`, \`District\`, \`Duration\`, \`Gender\`, \`Issue\`, \`Language\`, \`Mobile Number\`, and \`Name\`.

* **Division Call Center Data **: Data from the District Office Call Center. Key fields include \`Age Group\`, \`Agent Name\`, \`Call Date\`, \`Call Time\`, \`Call Type\`, \`Canton\`, \`Chat Date\`, \`Chat Time\`, \`Dialer Comments\`, \`Dialer Status\`, \`District\`, \`Duration\`, \`Gender\`, \`Issue\`, \`Language\`, \`Mobile Number\`, and \`Question\`.

* **MLA Call Center Data **: Data from the National Councillor Office Call Center. Key fields include \`Age Group\`, \`Agent Name\`, \`Call Date\`, \`Call Time\`, \`Call Type\`, \`Canton\`, \`Chat Date\`, \`Chat Time\`, \`Dialer Comments\`, \`Dialer Status\`, \`District\`, \`Duration\`, \`Gender\`, \`Issue\`, \`Language\`, \`Mobile Number\`, and \`Name\`.

* **Bridge & Common Data **: Auxiliary tables for bridging phone numbers and identifying common mobile numbers between chatbot and missed calls, along with various calculated measures and filters.

**Data Size:** The data is substantial, with the chatbot data alone showing over **2.3 million total chats**, and missed call data indicating nearly **1 million total missed calls**.

## üß† Methodology / Approach

The development of this dashboard followed a structured data analysis and visualization approach:

### üåê 1. Data Ingestion & Translation

* Collected raw data from various sources including English, French, and German chatbot logs, missed call data, and call center records (Our Call Center, National Councillor Office, District Office).

* Implemented an automated translation process using \`deep_translator\` (specifically \`GoogleTranslator\`) to convert non-English text in key columns (Language, Canton, District, Gender, Scheme, Issue) across multiple sheets into English. This ensured consistency and enabled unified analysis.

* Leveraged \`ThreadPoolExecutor\` for parallel processing during translation to enhance efficiency.

### üßπ 2. Data Cleaning & Standardization

This section details the automated data cleaning and standardization steps performed by the **Python script** (`chat bot daily cleaning file.ipynb`) before data is loaded into Power BI. These steps ensure data quality and consistency, which are crucial prerequisites for effective data modeling and DAX calculations.

* **Handling Translated Columns:** After the initial translation process, the Python script systematically drops the original language columns (e.g., 'Langue', 'Sexe') and any intermediate `_translated` columns. This (`df_sheet1 = df_sheet1.drop(columns=['Language_translated',...],errors='ignore')`) ensures that only the standardized English versions of the data are retained, removing redundancy and improving clarity.

* **Column Renaming:** The script consistently renames key columns across all datasets to establish a uniform naming convention. For instance, 'Phone' is renamed to 'Mobile Number' (`df_sheet1.rename(columns={'Phone': 'Mobile Number'}, inplace=True)`), and similar renames are applied to French ('T√©l√©phone' to 'Mobile Number', 'Nom' to 'Name') and German ('Telefonnummer' to 'Mobile Number') datasets.

* **Merging with Lookup Tables for Standardization:** To ensure consistent categorization and address potential variations or missing values (`NaN`) in critical categorical fields, the Python script merges the dataframes with external Excel lookup files. This process effectively standardizes values for categories such as `Language`, `Gender`, `Scheme`, `Issue`, `District`, and `Canton`. This merging ensures that all related terms are mapped to a single, predefined English term, which is vital for accurate aggregation and filtering in the Power BI dashboard.

* **Reordering Columns:** The script reorders columns into a logical and consistent sequence across all datasets. This improves readability and streamlines the data structure for subsequent analysis and data modeling in Power BI.

### üóÑÔ∏è 3. Data Modeling & Transformation

* Combined the cleaned chatbot, missed call, and various call center datasets to create a holistic view of the citizen journey.

* Derived key metrics and calculated fields necessary for performance analysis (e.g., total chats, chats transferred, call resolution rates by different call centers).

* **Implemented dynamic "Total Count" vs. "Unique Count" measures using DAX functions**. This allows the user to switch between viewing all interactions (Total Count) and unique citizen interactions (Unique Count) across various metrics like chats, missed calls, and call center activities. This provides a versatile analytical capability for different business perspectives. **Key DAX functions used include \`CALCULATE\`, \`COUNTROWS\`, \`DISTINCTCOUNT\`, \`FILTER\`, \`SELECTEDVALUE\`, \`SWITCH\`, \`UNION\`, \`INTERSECT\`, \`VALUES\`, and \`SELECTCOLUMNS\`.**

#### Key DAX Measures and Functions Explained

The following DAX measures were crucial for enabling the dynamic filtering and comprehensive analysis within the dashboard. Each measure is designed to provide a specific analytical perspective, often leveraging the "Total Count" vs. "Unique Count" selection:

* **`BridgePhoneNumbers`**:
  * **Purpose:** Creates a consolidated, distinct list of all phone numbers present across both the 'Chatbot Data' and 'Missed call Data' tables. This is foundational for linking related interactions from different channels.
  * **DAX Functions:** `DISTINCT`, `UNION`, `SELECTCOLUMNS`.
  * **Significance:** Ensures a comprehensive bridge table for cross-channel analysis, allowing for the identification of common citizens interacting via multiple platforms.

* **`Common_mob_between_chatbot_missed_call`**:
  * **Purpose:** Identifies the mobile numbers that are common to both 'Chatbot Data' and 'Missed call Data'. This highlights citizens who have interacted through both channels.
  * **DAX Functions:** `INTERSECT`, `VALUES`.
  * **Significance:** Crucial for understanding multi-channel engagement and for segmenting citizens who use different support methods.

* **`FilterChatbotCount`, `FilterMissedCallCount`, `FilterMLACalldone`, `FilterDivisionCalldone`, `Filtermissedcalldone`, `Filterourcallcenter`**:
  * **Purpose:** These are control measures that dynamically switch between "Total Count" and "Unique Count" for various interaction metrics (e.g., total chats, missed calls, calls handled by specific centers).
  * **DAX Functions:** `VAR`, `SELECTEDVALUE`, `RETURN`, `SWITCH`, `TRUE()`.
  * **Significance:** Provides a highly interactive user experience, allowing stakeholders to choose whether they want to see the sheer volume of interactions or the number of unique citizens involved, offering different analytical depths.

* **`Totalchats` (`COUNTROWS('1 Chatbot Data')`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Calculates the total number of rows in the '1 Chatbot Data' table, representing the absolute count of all chatbot interactions.
  * **DAX Function:** `COUNTROWS`.
  * **Significance:** Provides the raw volume of chatbot activity.

  * **Significance:** Helps understand the reach of the chatbot in terms of individual citizens served.

* **`TotalMissedCallCount` (`COUNTROWS('2 Missed call Data'), REMOVEFILTERS('1 Chatbot Data')`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Calculates the total number of missed call records. `REMOVEFILTERS` ensures that cross-filters from the Chatbot data don't affect this total, providing a standalone count.
  * **DAX Functions:** `CALCULATE`, `COUNTROWS`, `REMOVEFILTERS`.
  * **Significance:** Provides the overall volume of missed calls before any transfers.

* **`UniqueMissedCallCount` (`DISTINCTCOUNT('2 Missed call Data'[CALLER]), REMOVEFILTERS('1 Chatbot Data')`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Calculates the count of unique callers in the 'Missed call Data' table, independent of any filters from the Chatbot data.
  * **DAX Functions:** `CALCULATE`, `DISTINCTCOUNT`, `REMOVEFILTERS`.
  * **Significance:** Identifies the number of distinct citizens who experienced a missed call.

* **`Total_call_tranferes_to_callcenter`**:
  * **Purpose:** Calculates the total number of calls transferred to call centers by subtracting the common chatbot/missed call interactions from the total missed call count.
  * **DAX Function:** Basic arithmetic operation on other measures.
  * **Significance:** Quantifies the hand-off volume from automated systems to human agents.

* **`TotalMLACount`, `distintMLACount`**:
  * **Purpose:** Calculate the total count and distinct count of interactions for the MLA (National Councillor Office) Call Center, specifically based on mobile numbers.
