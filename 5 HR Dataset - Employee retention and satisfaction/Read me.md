## 🛠️ Methodology / Approach

A structured data analytics pipeline was followed to ensure reliability and clarity in outcomes:

### 📥 Data Import & Preparation

* Loaded the dataset into Power BI.

* Cleaned and prepared the data, which involved handling missing or inconsistent values and ensuring proper data types for numerical and categorical fields to maintain data integrity.

### 🔍 Data Analysis

I conducted targeted analyses to generate business-critical insights across multiple areas:

* **Employee Status Assessment**: Analyzed the number of active and inactive employees per business unit to identify retention gaps and inform hiring strategies.

* **Age Group Performance**: Explored the total number of employees per age group and their average ratings to identify performance trends and guide talent development.

### 📊 Data Visualization

* Designed and developed multiple **interactive Power BI dashboards**.

* These dashboards included various visual elements such as key performance indicator (KPI) cards, bar charts, and tabular views.

* The visualizations were designed with slicers and filters to allow for dynamic exploration, executive summaries, and drill-down insights, making complex HR data easily digestible.

## ✨ Key Results

The project surfaced several critical, actionable insights that enable data-driven decision-making:

* **💰 Cost Center Overview**: Provided a clear visualization of HR cost utilization across departments. For example, **Manufacturing** showed the **highest average tenure**, while **Executive Management** had the **highest salary costs**.

* **📉 Budget Planning Optimization**: Enabled HR to allocate resources more efficiently by providing insights into per-cost-center tenure and leave balance.

* **📈 Employee Activity & Retention**: Identified trends in active/inactive employees and highlighted business units with higher turnover risk. For instance, **Auckland** reported the **highest number of active employees**.

* **👥 Age Demographics & Ratings**: Delivered insights into which age groups had the largest representation and their average performance ratings, guiding employee development and succession planning.

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies Used

* **Power BI**: Utilized for comprehensive data modeling, creating advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures, and developing interactive dashboards.

* **Data Preparation**: Leveraged Power Query within Power BI for robust data cleaning, merging, and transformation (ETL) processes.
